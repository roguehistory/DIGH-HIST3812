The possible readings are grouped under four broad headings. They represent merely a starting point, not a canon. This list is non-exhaustive, non-canonical, and is heavily tilted towards museums. Let's fix that balance.

If a pdf is online, and you are able to open it in your browser, you should be able to use Hypothes.is on it. Sometimes you won't be able to. In those cases, get in touch with me right away so we can figure something out.
