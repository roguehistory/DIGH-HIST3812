I wanted to provide this link for those interested in AI-generated images [NightCafe Creator](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/). It is free and very good. Below are a few images and the prompts I used to generate the images. Think about how you can use this tool to create historical narratives or images to support your narrative and the implicit biases that are embedded into such programs. The prompts are a blend of text prompts I inputted and stylistic prompts chosen within the generator. I have Italicized the text prompts I inputted. It may be interesting for a group to consider Historical Storytelling via AI Image Generation. I may explore this myself and bring it to class. For now, consider the differences in the first two image prompts below and the differences in the images themselves. 

### Prompt
