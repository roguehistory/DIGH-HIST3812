A list of interesting / useful notebooks and other things

## Basic Skills

We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks in this class. For a global overview of how Jupyter notebooks work and are used in humanities research, see Quinn Dombrowski's lesson in [_The Programming Historian_](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks). The links below go to either live notebooks that you can work through, or guide you through some of the same steps that Dombrowski discusses, but with more detail.

+ Working with the Command Line
  - A walkthrough, by Chantal Brousseau
  - [For Windows](building/command-line-win/)
  - [For MacOS](/building/command-line-mac/)


+ [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/dhmuse-notebooks/master?urlpath=notebooks/getting-started-with-jupyter.ipynb); if that link breaks, launch [this](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/tdm-notebooks/master) and then select the notebook from the list.
    - Courtesy Nathan Kelber and Ted Lawless for JSTOR Labs, CC-BY
    - This notebook introduces Jupyter notebooks and Python for absolute beginners.
    - Going further: Kelber and Lawless have a number of notebooks for working with JSTOR's 'Data for Research' dataset creation service; [find out more here](https://tdm-pilot.org/)

  - A walkthrough, by Chantal Brousseau

+ [How to install R in Jupyter Notebooks](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/#binary-panel)
  - Run these commands in the R console (you should be able to find it by searching "R" in your applications)
  - In reference to step 2, you want to install this **system-wide**

+ [Using Git on the Command Line to Keep your Notebook Under Version Control](building/more-github/)
  - A walkthrough, by Dr. Graham and Chantal Brousseau

## Retrieve and Visualize Data

### Retrieving data

If the data is already made available on the open web, and it's in a reasonable format (json or csv) then it's not too difficult a task.

+ Loading simple data that you've found online into a Notebook
  - a [walkthrough](#)

+ [Working with Pandas to Manipulate Data](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/dhmuse-notebooks/master?urlpath=notebooks/pandas-1.ipynb)

+ Using OpenRefine to Obtain Data
  - This tutorial adapts the Programming Historian lesson by Evan Peter Williamson ["Fetching and Parsing Data from the Web with OpenRefine", especially its example 2](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/fetch-and-parse-data-with-openrefine#example-2-url-queries-and-parsing-json).
  - Tutorial link [here](#).

+ Extract Illustrated Pages from the Hathi Trust & Internet Archive
  - This tutorial & associated notebooks are developed from Stephen Krewson's piece for the Programming Historian, ["Extracting Illustrated Pages from Digital Libraries with Python"](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/extracting-illustrated-pages)
  - Try searching for images related to "Ottawa".
  - [Hathi Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/dhmuse-notebooks/master?urlpath=notebooks/hathitrust.ipynb);
  - [Internet Archive Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/dhmuse-notebooks/master?urlpath=notebooks/internetarchive.ipynb)
  - the json file for the notebooks is in the 'data' folder

+ Retrieve data from a 'datasette'-created API [launch binder here](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/open-context-jupyter/master?urlpath=notebooks/retrieving%20data%20from%20a%20datasette%20api.ipynb)
  - note that the 'api_search_url' variable might need to be changed to point to the survey markers datasette or the CARF excavation datasette re Fort Frontenac (see below for url)

+ Scraper. [This notebook](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/notebooks/simple-scraper) adapts [this tutorial on beautiful soup](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) to work with data from the Museum of History.

+ Working with web archives, a series of notebooks by Sherratt et al [https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/](https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/) (including the Internet Archive, so potentially you might find Ottawa things there.)

+ GLAM Notebooks from [BVMC.Labs 'Inspiring computationally-driven research with the British Library's digital collections'](http://data.cervantesvirtual.com/blog/notebooks/) working with a wide variety of European datasets and archival sources.

+ National Library of Scotland, Data Foundry: [A Medical History of British India](https://data.nls.uk/tools/jupyter-notebooks/exploring-a-medical-history-of-british-india/)

+ National Library of Scotland, Data Foundry: [Edinburgh Ladies' Debating Society](https://data.nls.uk/tools/jupyter-notebooks/exploring-edinburgh-ladies-debating-society/)

### Visualize

+ Visualizing Data with Bokeh & Python
    - This notebook is the one that accompanies the tutorial by Charlie Harper in [_The Programming Historian_](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh)
    - You can launch the notebook [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shawngraham/dhmuse-notebooks/master?urlpath=notebooks/viz-w-bokeh.ipynb); this will let you skip setting up the virtual environment (a way of keeping all of your lego pieces for each task separate so they don't cause conflicts).

+ [Topic Modelling and Creating Interactive Visuals in R](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ChantalMB/tm-visualisation/master)

+ There might be useful things in [Hands-On Data Visualization](https://handsondataviz.org); not explicitly about jupyter notebooks, but give it a look.

## Documentation

+ Building an [API with Datasette](/building/datasette-guidance)

+ Building a documentation website with Mkdocs
  - MKDocs is a python module that will turn a folder with markdown documents into a functioning website

## Creativity

For when you're ready/inclined to push things further.

+ [Sonification](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/sonification/master?urlpath=notebooks/Intro%20to%20Sonification.ipynb)
  - An overview of how and why you might sonify data

+ [Image Glitching](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/creativity/master?urlpath=notebooks/Glitching%20an%20image%20with%20prism%20sorting.ipynb)
  - An overview of why glitching an image might be one way of letting people play with collections

+ [An introduction to 'Processing', a language for quick sketches, visualizations, and artwork](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/processing/master?urlpath=notebooks/python%20with%20processing.ipynb)
  - A simple introduction to a language that enables creative expression (Brian Foo, the 'Data Driven DJ' uses processing to make visualizations to accompany his sonifications. See for instance his work, [Lee and Jackson](https://datadrivendj.com/tracks/painters/).)
