## Final Group Project Expectations and Guideline

Below is an outline of my expectations for your final research project. 

As stated in the [evaluation](<[4. Evaluation – HIST3812a](https://digitalbyzantine.netlify.app/docs/4-evaluation/#5-final-project)>) section of the course website, the final project will be evaluated on both individual and group criteria. 10% based on your contribution to the final project, 10% on the project’s historical and digital content (This will be based on your deliverable submitted to me to assess) and 15% based on your group’s final project presentation (Each group member **MUST** present a component of their final project). The final project will be submitted to the professor at 11:59 p.m. the night before your group presentation.

The final project has two major components: a Public-facing deliverable and the Group Presentation. For the public-facing deliverable, your group will create and submit a digital medium that depicts/tells a historical narrative for public consumption. For example, if your research topic is how German soldiers are represented in Call of Duty: WWII, choose how you want to present that history to the public. This can be in a YouTube video, podcast, Website, Digital Game format, or any other public-facing digital medium you choose. You need to justify this approach in your proposal and research. The purpose of the public-facing deliverable component of this project is to force you to critically assess and consider how to represent historical narratives to the general public. Think about the central theme of your research and what you want the public to learn from your research. What is the best method to present your academic research for public consumption? Think about what and what not to include and why. How does this affect the narrative?

Other considerations are the implications of using proprietary software vs open-source. What limitations and advantages do each have? Who owns your data when your project is complete? Is your project accessible to everyone? If not, why not and is this intentional? There is much to consider when creating a public-facing exhibition/historical narrative. Who is your audience? Does the platform/digital medium consider those with physical limitations? Are you targeting children, teenagers, young adults or an older demographic like myself? Is your project a deep dive into a specific historical topic, or are you providing a general narrative? Do you have objects and images that need to be part of your project, and if so, do you have permission to use these materials? **We will discuss many of these topics over the coming weeks.**

The second component is your class presentation. Here, you will provide the class with the scholarly side of your research. Why did you choose this topic, what methods did you use to approach the subject, and what issues did you encounter while developing the public-facing side of your research? What theoretical approaches did you apply (Post-colonial theory, Marxism, Queer Theory, Intersectionality, Post-modernism etc.), and how did this inform your research and the choices you made in constructing a digital public-facing historical narrative.  The presentation is an academic analysis of your public-facing deliverable. Each presentation will be between 15-20 min MAX, and all group members must participate in the class presentation. There will be 5 minutes of Q&A after each presentation. 

Presentations will be on December 4th and 7th. I will create a signup sheet for the dates and times for your presentations. The last two weeks of November will be dedicated to in-class group work for your final projects. In these classes, which ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY, I will present a shortened lecture on a digital topic/tool/platform that I hope you will find instructive and helpful for your group project. After which, groups will work together on their projects, and I will float around, supporting your group as needed.  

After I have marked your proposals, I will meet with each group to discuss your research proposals and any concerns, suggestions, resources and technical details I may have. Hopefully, these meetings will be at most fifteen minutes and will be held during a designated time slot for each group during my office hours. We will book these next week. 

Lastly, this project is meant to be FUN! I am providing you with the opportunity to perform rigorous scholarly research and be creative in its presentation. It is an opportunity to explore unconventional approaches to historical discourse in an environment that promotes creativity and alternative digital methods. So be daring and swing for the fences. BE CREATIVE. BE CURIOUS. BE FEARLESS.
