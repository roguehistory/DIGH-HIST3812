Hello, Class. 

Here are a few notes from today. As I said at the beginning of class, your third podcast analysis is now due **December 14th at 11:59 pm**, with no exceptions. I decided to change the date, again, to give you the time and the opportunity to focus on your group projects without any other in-class distractions (and for me to get my butt in gear and write the instructions for the assignment). I will have the instructions posted by next class.

Secondly, for your case studies, remember to focus on how those who support or refute Graham Hancock present their evidence and what their sources are. Are these sources credible? Did they cite their evidence or provide links for the audience to access where they obtained their sources?  I am looking forward to your presentations on Tuesday. Keep them short. 5 -7 mins. Hopefully, this will leave us time for some discussion between presentations or at the end of class. 

Below is a link to the qualitative analysis using Obsidian I was speaking about in class.

Finally, presentations will be on December 5th and December 7th. Four groups will present on December 5th, and three on December 7th. This will give us some time to conclude the term on December 7th with a discussion about the overall themes of the course. On Tuesdays class, your group will choose a day to present. 

Have a great weekend!
