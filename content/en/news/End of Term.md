Dear Class. 

As the term comes to a close, I want to thank you all for your participation, collaboration and feedback in the class. It has truly been an enjoyable and instructive semester. I am very proud of you all for your contributions to the class, group projects, case studies and, most importantly, your patience with me in the development of this course. I wish you all a very happy holiday season and all the best in the new year.
