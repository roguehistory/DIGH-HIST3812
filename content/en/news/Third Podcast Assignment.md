Dan Carlin's *Hardcore History* is a popular long-form history podcast that presents a particular historical period over multiple hours and episodes. As a "non-professional" amateur Historian whose background is in journalism, Carlin's attention to detail and unique approach to historical inquiry and narratives has made the podcast popular among Historical enthusiasts and amateurs. Indeed, Carlin's *Blueprint for Armageddon* drew me into the realm of Podcasting. He is provocative, engaging, and thorough, with many calling his podcasts mini-historical audiobooks, demonstrating that history can be publicly accessible and performed by untraditional means. However, many consider his podcasts as "Popular History" and that the histories Carlin narrates cannot be equated to or considered as rigorous scholarship. Nevertheless, many have praised Carlin's approach and making *Histories* accessible to a larger audience. 

For your final podcast analysis, I want you to choose a podcast from Dan Carlin's *Hardcore History* and consider whether the long-form podcast genre is a viable approach for teaching History.  Consider all the various methods used to present history via the podcast over the semester and answer the question: Does podcasting disrupt the traditional notions of what scholarly historical inquiry is, and do we, as historical scholars, need to re-consider our pedagogical approaches to teaching history? 

You have 750 words MAX to answer the above question. Below are some opinion pieces, reviews, and analyses on Dan Carlin's podcast and approach.  Have Fun!!
