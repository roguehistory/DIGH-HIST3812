## General Update

Good morning, Class, and welcome to week three. 

I hope everyone had a relaxing weekend. For this week, we will be asking: What is Digital History and breaking this question into numerous subthemes. Please see [Weekly Instructions](https://github.com/roguehistory/DIGH-HIST3812/new/master/content/en/news). 

What I am particularly interested in is your thoughts on the in-between spaces of what I like to call "Private" History (aka academic History), Public History, and Digital History. What connects these disciplines and where do they intersect? Where does archaeology fall into this melting pot of disciplines/fields of study?  For Tuesday, we will address the assigned readings and how they distinguish the "past" from "history" and what that means for defining the above-mentioned disciplines.  On Thursday, we will explore Seefeldt and Thomas, Brennan, and have our first Podcast Wrap-up and discuss the PUBlic History podcast. Again, apologies for the poor audio quality. The rest will be better. I promise.

Throughout the week we will also be using Obsidian and Hypothes.is. So bring your Digital devices to class so that you can create notes on what we are discussing. The more we apply and use these programs, the easier they become.

Weekly MEME: 
I've decided to do weekly memes and post them here for you. Use Hypothes.is to comment on them. Give me your thoughts on whether memes can be facilitators of Digital History.
