## Random Thoughts

Good morning, class. 

I created this page to share any class updates, happenings and my general musings with you. This is an informal page and will be 
maintained informally. What I mean by that is it will be more of a casual je ne sais quoi, i.e. a lot of history/archaeology memes.
Like the one below, which sums up everything right and wrong about what archaeology is. 

{{< alert theme="warning" >}} If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see on this page, let me know. If you would like
to make a contribution to this page, PLEASE, let me know!
