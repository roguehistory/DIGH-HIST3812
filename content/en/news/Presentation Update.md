## Expectations

There is some confusion about what you will present to the class and the public-facing component of the final research project.  Hopefully, the following will clarify this. An analogy that may help is: Think about this final project as a webpage. Say Facebook. There is a front end (your FB profile page) and a back end (all the code that makes it work). The Public-Facing deliverable is the front-end, and the class presentation is the back end. Does that make sense? If not, read the below expectations.

## Public-Facing Deliverable

In essence, this is any digital medium that you will use to present your research to the public—for example, the website for the [Syrios project](https://syrios.uh.edu/) or those mural projects on our class website [Mural Storytelling – HIST3812a](https://digitalbyzantine.netlify.app/building/6.muralexamples/). I expect your group to have a public-facing digital product that the class can access/engage/interact with via an online platform completed and submitted the day before you present to the class. This is to allow the class time to view the product and be able to link your class presentation to the final product when you discuss it the following day. So, if you are presenting on December 5th, then the Public-Facing deliverable needs to be submitted by December 4th, 11:59 pm. 
If your project only partially comes together in the manner which you had hoped, **DO NOT STRESS**. Things break, fail, and never go to plan in the digital sphere, which is okay. How we adapt and adjust to these speed bumps informs and teaches us. It doesn't have to be perfect. Please deliver what you have so the class can experience it and then explain your processes in your...

## Presentation

Your presentation is the Scholarly-Facing side of the project; therefore, conduct your presentation in a scholarly manner.  You are presenting to fellow Historians, Digital Historians, Digital Humanists and Archaeologists. The class presentation is meant for you to discuss the behind-the-scenes workings of your Digital Public-Facing Historical Research. The presentation can be via a PowerPoint presentation, Mural, etc. I expect you to discuss the processes, methods, theories and collaboration that went into the project and how your scholarly research informs the Public-Facing medium. If things broke or failed, tell us why. How did you overcom it? How did you adapt? If there is a debate about a particular historical piece of evidence, discuss how this debate informed how your group depicted your topic for public consumption. Was there disagreement in your group about how to tell the historical narrative, and if so, how did you negotiate a solution?  

Some questions you need to address in your presentation:

1. What is your research question and thesis for the project?
2. What was your conclusion? 
3. What did you want the public to gain/understand/learn from your project?
4. Why did you choose said digital platform to present your historical narrative to the public?
5. What proved to be successful, and what was not successful? 

**A BIBLIOGRAPHY IN YOUR PRESENTATION IS MANDATORY.**

All deliverables (Public and Scholarly) must be submitted via Brightspace on the day you present! This is different from submitting the public component the day before you present. **THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS**.

Again, if you have questions, please email me, come to office hours, or talk to me in class.
