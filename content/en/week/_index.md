## Weekly Schedule

{{< notice success "Important" >}} The syllabus can change, and will change, depending on how this course goes. I will Update the Schedule weekly as needed based on our progress. When changes are made, I will inform you via your Carleton email/Brightspace/Discord. Please check before you come to class to ensure you do not miss any notices.
