## Week Nine (Oct. 31 & November 2, 2023)

##### (Collaborative Project Proposal Due in class, Nov 2nd)

## Museums Gone Digital: The Digital Subaltern.

**"Just as colonialism and digital humanities are both projects in world making, postcolonial digital humanities, I argue, emphasizes the possibility of creating new worlds that resist inscriptions of colonialism in the digital cultural record" (Risam 2019: 20).**

### Goals for this week

1) 

### Museums, Digital Colonialism/Orientalism and the subaltern

---
## Do

The theme for this class is drawn from the "Introduction" of Laurajane Smith's (2020) book *Emotional Heritage*. It is necessary to ask ourselves why we (the public) visit museums and what our expectations are. Smith notes two possible reasons: To learn and to recreate.  Smith also states it is more complicated than just learning and recreating, that visitors are also Heritage-making, but what does this mean? How do we make heritage, and can this be done digitally? What happens when the ancient/medieval intersects with modern technology and the Digital in museums?  

This week, we discuss the digital subaltern and explore the colonial presence that continues to make the "other" difficult to witness in museums. We will examine four museums: the Byzantine and Christian Museum (BCM) in Athens, *The Coin Cabinet* of [PalazzoBlu](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/PalazzoBlu/) Museum, the Museum of Byzantine Culture (MBC) in Thessaloniki and the Acropolis Museum in Athens. We will discuss the differences between each museum and how they present History through, if available, the museum's virtual tours, permanent online exhibitions, and material culture databases.  The objective is to get a sense of how Byzantine history and identity are presented to the 'digital' public via the web and begin brainstorming ideas to re-imagine the storytelling of Byzantine history to the public. 

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

+ Use Hypothesis to annotate the readings.
+ Make notes in your Obsidian Vault. 

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your final group project. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
