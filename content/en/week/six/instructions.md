### Goals for this week

1) Readings and Podcast (I know, but it needs to be done).
2) Explore [Archaeology Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) and annotate with Hypothes.is
3) Improve your digital literacy...*cough, cough*...Use Obsidian. 

## The Digital and Archaeology.

>"An enchanted digital archaeology remembers that when we are using computers, the computer is not a passive tool. It is an active agent in its own right... The way it is built, the way the code is designed, contains so many elements of unconscious bias from all of its myriad creators...the computer is our co-creator (Graham 2020: 8).

Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This week, we explore the intersection of digital technologies with Byzantine archaeology. We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allows for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital _public_ archaeology.

**_The Most Important Ideas_**

1) Archaeology's genesis was in racism, and colonialism - Byzantine archaeology is no exception.
2) Digital technology's birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.
3) If you put those two things together _without taking into account the implications_, then we're in for a lot of trouble.

So what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, those two monstrous births, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human? Archaeology isn't necessarily about the past. It's about the materiality of the past _and present_ and, in many ways, the future. How does modern materiality help inform us about past materiality - especially with those objects infused with multiple histories and agencies? We try to understand how the digital tools we use are entangled with biases but also extend humanity in powerful ways it's easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity's worst impulses (Think about Adam Goldwyn's chapter on Byzantium and Alt-Right/White Supremacist groups).

### Do: Parsing the Digital Dirt.

Visit [Archaeology Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) and peruse through the available resources, and digitally "excavate" (use Hypothes.is to annotate the site) for evidence of "Byzantine" presence. Describe and discuss how Byzantine material culture is represented on the website. 

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

+ Use Hypothesis to annotate the readings.
+ Make notes in your Obsidian Vault. 

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your final group project. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
