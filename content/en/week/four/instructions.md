>"Traditional academic work is often hidden behind subscription-only paywalls or written in the jargony language of the academy; [Douglas] Galbi's (and his fellow travellersâ€™) posts, by contrast, are freely and widely available on the internet and written in a plain and easily accessible style. It is almost certain, therefore, that their works have a larger audience than all but the most successful of their scholarly sources" (Goldwyn 2022: 428).

Adam Goldwyn is speaking about the public-facing side of Byzantine history and how alt-right groups are using and manipulating the Christian identity of Byzantium for their ideological goals. Goldwyn's chapter also speaks to the "othering" of Byzantine identity. That is, who is and is not included based on ideological motives. Do scholars create impenetrable barriers that the public can not break through, leading the public to search for alternatives, or does the ambiguity of "Byzantine" allow for identity manipulation? If the term "Byzantine" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term "Byzantine" at museums? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity on the web and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites. We will excavate identities from four museum websites and explore how museums create identity categories. Who is Byzantine? Who is Roman? Who is "Other"?

### Do

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
