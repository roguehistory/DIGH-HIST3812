### Goals for this week

1. Do Readings and Listen to Podcast
2. Ask ChatGPT "Who are the Byzantines?" and prepare to share with the class. 
3. Continue to improve your digital literacy - Think of a digital medium to suggest to your Group.

### The Byzant...I mean Romans
In short, the Byzantines were Romans (Romaioi) who lived within the ever-fluctuating borders of the Eastern Roman Empire (_Rhōmania_ or Romanland). This is an oversimplified answer, of course. Thus, in this class, our objective is to situate how the labels "Byzantium" and "Byzantine" came into common usage in modern scholarship and the effects on how scholars study medieval Roman identity. In other words, what do we mean when we use the labels Byzantium and Byzantine? What impact do these terms have on our historical and archaeological understandings of the Eastern Roman Empire?

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.
