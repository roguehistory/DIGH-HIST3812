Oh, Graham! 
For this week's case study, we will dive into Graham Hancock's *Ancient Apocalypse* and the responses to this Netflix "Docuseries" via social media. Many claim that Hancock is a pseudo-archaeologist/scientist, while he claims that he is an investigative journalist trying to understand human pre-history. Despite each claim, Hancock is a successful author, has access to major digital platforms (The Joe Rogan Experience), and has a devoted base of followers. Thus, arguably, Hancock is an influential individual in the presentation of human pre-history in digital spheres.

I want us to focus on the evidence that the docuseries and the social media rebuttals present and critically assess how each represents the past. Is the evidence substantiated or peer-reviewed? As all of these platforms are digital public-facing mediums, it is necessary to understand how evidence is gathered and presented to the public. What sources are being used? Where is their evidence coming from? Are they peer-reviewed? This week's case study is a deep dive into the methods and theories used to collect, analyze and present history to the public via digital mediums. In your groups, you are to choose one episode from *Ancient Apocalypse* and perform a rigorous academic assessment of the available evidence presented by Hancock and those who refute him from the episode you chose. I want you to research and collect data, perform an analysis and come to your own conclusions. You are to document all your findings and research in the obsidian vault via process notes, zettle notes, and other digital means necessary. **There are eight episodes; I expect each group to choose a different episode. I do want two groups doing the same episode. Please claim your episode via Discord. I will set up a channel for you to submit your claim. This is first come, first served. If you have any concerns, please feel free to email me or see me during office hours.**

I am expecting a critical analysis using the themes explored in class and how history is (re)presented on social media platforms and answer the question: Can we, or should we, hold these mediums to the same degree of rigorous review as we do with peer-reviewed articles in academic journals/books? Can such a lofty objective/goal be achieved? How do we approach individuals like Hancock, who are combative and hostile towards archaeologists, and create an open dialogue that does not dismiss the individual but just their historical claims? We all know there are a lot of "Trolls" out there who seek to mislead and misinform, and given the digital depths that social media allows people to plunge into, we need to be cognizant about how to create an inclusive dialogue about the evidence without being disparaging to those who have alternative views. 

Below are just a few reviews of Hancock's work. You are not restricted to these, and I EXPECT you to seek out as much peer-reviewed evidence as possible to support your claims. The focus is on the process on academic rigorousness. Be as rigorous and critical of the reviews of Hancock's work as we are towards Hancock himself. The following Tuesday (November 21st), we will present our findings in class. We will begin our next class (November 14th) with a review of Hancock's docuseries and then dive into our research.

Have Fun!!
