In this episode, we hear from [Danuta Sierhuis](https://www.danutasierhuis.ca/), museum technologist, arts administrator and fibre artist, and currently the Digital Development Coordinator at Agnes Etherington Art Centre at Queen's University. Danuta has an MA in Art History with Digital Humanities.


### Do

**If you're feeling overwhelmed, you can take a break this week. Just continue to play with the notebooks from week nine. You don't have to do the items below unless you feel so inclined.**

##### Now Optional:

1. Make a new notebook (or modify an existing one) to load data from a new datasource.
2. ~~Visualize the provenance of your data using Leaflet~~
3. Or go for something complete different; try out some [sonification](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/sonification/master?urlpath=Intro%20to%20Sonification.ipynb) on your data

I don't expect you to do these on your own in splendid isolation; I also don't expect that everyone will complete them. Just push yourself until you get stuck, then talk about it / look for help in Discord.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

Create a repository on Github; you can make it private.

Make a text file and call it `journal.md`. Put the date in it, write brief notes so that when you come back to all of this, you'll know what you were doing.

Drag and drop this file, and any other supporting materials you wish, onto your repository; once they've uploaded, hit the 'commit' button.

Share your repo in our Discord space if you want me or someone else to have a look if there are problems - or victories!

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your eventual GLAM notebook you create. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.
