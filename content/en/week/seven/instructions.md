### Goals for this week

1) Readings and Podcasts (I know, but it needs to be done).
2) Navigate Sketchfab and Global Digital History and play with 3D imaging.
3) Think about how you could use 3D imaging for your group project.
4) Improve your digital literacy. Try making your own 3D image of anything you like.


## Considering a Digital Archaeology

>"An enchanted digital archaeology remembers that when we are using computers, the computer is not a passive tool. It is an active agent in its own right... The way it is built, the way the code is designed, contains so many elements of unconscious bias from all of its myriad creators...the computer is our co-creator (Graham 2020: 8).

Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on-site, in the lab, or on the web? What happens to material culture recovered from archaeological sites and how are artifacts represented digitally? What does digital visualization mean, and what effect does digital visualization, compared to physical interaction, have on the public's emotive experience with material culture? 

This week, we explore the intersection of digital technologies with Byzantine archaeology. We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allows for novel engagements with the past; we explore 3D visual representations of the Byzantine past through two different public-facing platforms: [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and [Global Digital Heritage](https://globaldigitalheritage.org/). These two platforms are excellent sources to explore how 3D models are used to present ancient material culture to the public. 

{{< notice success "Important!" >}} **_The Most Important Ideas_**

1) Archaeology's genesis was in racism, and colonialism - Byzantine archaeology is no exception.
2) Digital technology's birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.
3) If you put those two things together _without taking into account the implications_, then we're in for a lot of trouble.{{< /notice>}}

So what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human? Archaeology isn't necessarily about the past. It's about the materiality of the past _and present_ and, in many ways, the future. Public Archaeology is about how we engage the public, how the public engages with archaeology, and more importantly, how we perform inclusive archaeology with the public that allows communities to participate, create and tell their archaeological stories.  How does modern materiality help inform us about past materiality - especially with those objects infused with multiple histories and agencies, and into modern materiality (inclusive of the digital)? This week, we try to understand how the digital tools we use are entangled with biases but also extend humanity in powerful ways it's easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity's worst impulses (Think about Adam Goldwyn's chapter on Byzantium and Alt-Right/White Supremacist groups).

### Do

>"The idea of a ‘digital twin’ carries connotations of a replica, a duplicate, a facsimile, the digital equivalent of a material entity, and conveniently summons up the impression of a virtual exact copy of something that exists in the real world" (Huggett 2023)


The week's first class will be dedicated to the readings, situating how data becomes visual representations and narratives while considering the power dynamics behind visuality and the gaze (Staiff 2014). We explore the "Digital Twin" (Huggett 2023), the differences between aesthetic qualities in digital objects versus material culture, and affective practices to develop strategies for creating enchantment around archaeology (Perry 2019). What types of meta-data should be included in the creation of 3D models, and how to synthesize complex processes into meaningful and informative digital visualizations for scholars and the public (Hess et al., 2018)? 

{{< notice success "Reminder!" >}} Use the Hypothes.is and Obsidian to document and link your observations and digital excavating processes, and remember to cite the museums with [Hyperlinks](https://www.byzantinemuseum.gr/en/) to the relevant page when you use obsidian. What were some of the case study's challenges and successes? Link your thoughts to other individuals from other groups. {{< /notice>}}

In Thursday's class, we will interact with a few 3D and 2D Digital visualizations of coins and compare this experience with handling physical coins. We will discuss the positives and negatives of using 3D coin models versus Roman coins to represent Roman identities. Did one experience provide a more evocative and emotive experience? Furthermore, think back to the museums we explored earlier in the semester and compare the differences between the interfaces' visuality and the ability to interact with material culture to this week's exercise. How do these differences inform your strategies for developing an inclusive and engaging visual exhibit? Would you use 3D modelling for your group project? How?

### Do, if you wish.

With the advancement of technology, specifically smartphones (are they really smart?), anyone who owns a smartphone can create a 3D image. This week, if you have a smartphone, try downloading an app that allows you to create a 3D image on your phone. Document the process and discuss how this "digital twin" represents the physical object. Does 3D imaging give the public an opportunity to participate in Digital history/archaeology? Is the public "doing" Digital History?

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.{{< /notice >}}

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

+ Use Hypothesis to annotate the readings.
+ Make notes in your Obsidian Vault. 

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your final group project. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.
