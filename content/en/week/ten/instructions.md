### Goals for this week

1. Cleaning data to make it useable
2. Pushing data to the web

### Listen

6th episode of the podcast


### Do

1. [Cleaning Data with R](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ChantalMB/cleaning-data-r/master)
2. Work with data in tabular format. For this, I'd like you to launch and follow along [Melanie Walsh's excellent four-part tutorial](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Data-Analysis/Data-Analysis.html) on working with tabular data in Python using the 'pandas' data package. To launch the individual parts of that tutorial, look for the rocket ship icon and hit that (or download and run on your own machine).
2. Go further: put data online with [Datasette](/building/datasette-guidance/). Subset some data you've already collected from an Ottawa collection. Think about which columns of the data would be useful, which cases (rows) of the data might make a good collection. Don't include actual image files if you have them; instead use a link to the online location of the images. This will be more challenging than you might first expect, since it requires you to transform the data, documenting your decisions along the way, and then doing command line work to get it into online space you control. You might wish instead to treat this as more of a thought-experiment (noting the things you'd need to learn to achieve it).

I don't expect you to do these on your own in splendid isolation; I also don't expect that everyone will complete them. Just push yourself until you get stuck, then talk about it / look for help in Discord.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

Create a repository on Github; you can make it private.

Make a text file and call it `journal.md`. Put the date in it, write brief notes so that when you come back to all of this, you'll know what you were doing.

Drag and drop this file, and any other supporting materials you wish, onto your repository; once they've uploaded, hit the 'commit' button.

Share your repo in our Discord space if you want me or someone else to have a look if there are problems - or victories!

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your eventual GLAM notebook you create. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.
