I wanted this course to be about exploration and figuring out what this field, Digital History, meant for Byzantine Studies. As I began building this course in the relatively short span in which I was allotted, I realized I wanted to emulate my supervisor, Dr. Graham's pedagogical approach. I want the course to be all about you, and _your_ exploration. That's how meaning emerges, right? So I've discussed, fiddled, listened to you in the first class and tried to come up with a way for you to set the agenda and still meet the learning goals.  I hope I succeed and meet your expectations. 

### Goals for this week

1. Settle the schedule
2. Explore Obsidian.md and Hypothesis.is
3. Understand what this course is about
4. Start thinking about your goals for this course

This week is about reading the syllabus and understanding what is expected of you in this course. Get Hypothesis, Discord, and Obsidian set up; introduce yourself to the class in the `social` channel in Discord. Take your time, read through the instructions, and ask for help of your peers or send me a note. **You are encouraged to collaborate throughout in this course; just acknowledge help you receive from others**.


### Listen

Roddick, Andy. 2022   _From Info-Glut to Connected Notes: Obsidian and Digital Note-Taking in Academia_ DMDS Workshops. [Obsidian and Digital-Note Taking in Academia](https://scds.github.io/dmds-22-23/Obsidian.html) 

{{< notice success "Important" >}}
Make sure to listen to each weekly episode - talk about the podcast in Discord! It can be hard to start a conversation from scratch with strangers in person or online, and I totally understand the anxiety this may inflict; but, try, reach out, and maybe post some observations or statements from the podcast/video that surprised you or immediately challenge your ideas about what this course might be about. Try to do this each week, and our Discord will start to feel like a 'real' place!

## Do

### Obsidian: What is it?
This week, we will explore [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), a program that can be run on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and more. I will show you how to install it onto your computer (it's free) and provide a tutorial on its basic functionality. The program uses Markdown (md) language (plain text) that is "future-proof" for note-taking and stores files locally on your computer with the option to sync through cloud services. Think of Obsidian as your second brain to store your thoughts, ideas, and inspirations. We will use Obsidian to develop notes together and independently and generate weekly discussions amongst our peers. By the end of the term, my goal is for us to have a significant repository of notes compiled that will allow you to think critically and creatively and inform your final project. We will explore the Zettlekasten system (Atomic notes), and what backlinks, outgoing links, Tags, and mindmaps (Cnavas) can do for your note creation. We will also discuss strategic reading and note-taking. 

Obsidian is relatively easy to learn, and you do not need to be a coder, programmer or techie to learn or use the software. Trust me, I am from the pre-internet era and quickly learned this. We will start by developing notes together in week two. Since archaeological sites and museums are comprised of individuals working as teams to excavate and create knowledge about the past and promote knowledge exploration and dissemination to the public, I want us to explore how we create and disseminate knowledge both independently and as a collective in this course.  

#### Readings: 
**Sönke Ahrens'  book, _How to Take Smart Notes_, is meant for you to skim through for the duration of the course. This is not, strictly speaking, a peer-reviewed academic book, but it is a great source to learn how to create notes or Atomic notes. As Andy Roddick (2022) observes, making notes, not taking notes, forces you to think more critically about the ideas you formulate and record as notes.**

Ahrens, Sönke. 2017   _How to Take Smart Notes : One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers._ Place of publication is not identified_. Sönke Ahrens. 

### Do

Tech Set Up Time!

#### 1. Get Hypothesis & Join Our Class Group

Create an account at [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is):

Get the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:

Make sure you're logged in:

Then join [our HIST/DIGH 3812a reading group](https://hypothes.is/groups/7rRegnDX/hist-digh-3812). If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the 'reply' button on the annotation to start a conversation! Sometimes, the person to whom you're replying might be a previous year's student, but that's ok; they might enter into conversation with you. Sometimes, it might be a person who isn't a Carleton student but is following along with the course. That's ok too. Be respectful!

[There is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Read that for the full information on how to use Hypothesis.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Hypothesis exists on the open web, so make sure you're always making your annotations in the **group space**, not the **public** space. Finally, you may want to use the [crowdlaaers](https://crowdlaaers.org/) service to keep track of the global development of our annotation space - go to that site, click on 'Groups', and follow the prompts to connect your Hypothesis account to the service.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} By all means, try some of the more technical aspects of Obsidian. But remember: with tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
