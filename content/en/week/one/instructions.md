### Goals for this week
 1. Introduce yourself. [X]
 2. Chat about the course. [x]
 



#### 2. Join our Discord

Discord is a chat server that also allows voice, video, and screensharing. We will use it in this class mostly as a social space and a space to get help, especially in the more technical aspects of what we're doing.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} I don't want heroic lone scholars. If you are struggling with something - whether it's the ideas in the readings or the tech - look for help; DM me privately, or post in the relevant week's channel. If you can help someone, jump in. **I encourage collaboration**. If you get help from someone, just acknowledge it in your own work. Also: **in tech work, if it doesn't come in 30 minutes, it won't come in 3 hours** Asking for help is not a weakness: it's a sign of strength & scholarly maturity.
{{< /notice >}}

You can download Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/apps) or you can [use it in a broswer](https://discordapp.com/app).

**You will receive an invitation email in your Carleton account.** It expires after one day, so do join once you get it. It will ask to verify your email; check your spam folder.

Once you're in, there's a welcome message with a reaction emoji at the end - click on the thumbs up to confirm that you've read the message. This will unlock the various channels in the server, including voice and screensharing.

And yes, I recycled screenshots from my Crafting Digital History course, but the DHMuse version is more or less the same and hey, I built this course website by hand.

(Alex is a student who works for me on [the bone trade project](http://bonetrade.github.io) if you were wondering.)

You can customize your profile by clicking on the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the navigation:

and you can customize how you'd like to use voice and video:

There's a channel for each week's materials, a channel for general museum or Carleton chat, and a social channel just for shooting the breeze. If you want to chat or stream your machine (eg to show us what you're trying to do and how it's not working) just click on one of the side-chats - make sure you're unmuted! Dr. Graham also has a private office for voice and video and you can ask him directly to speak there.

Discord has accessibility features, [more details here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035966492-Screen-Reader-Data-Toggle)

#### 3. Github

Github can be a bit tricky, so I've given it its own page, which you can [consult over here](/building/github-guidance). Just take your time. You should be able to do this in about 30 - 45 minutes.
