### Goals for this week
 1. Introduce yourself. [X]
 2. Chat about the course. [x]
 
### Listen

The course podcast will be my opportunity to speak to you each week about what's going on in this course, things I want you to pay attention to, and individuals in the wider GLAM world that I want to introduce you to through a series of interviews.

{{< notice success "Important" >}}
Make sure to listen to each episode - talk about the podcast in Discord! It can be hard to start a conversation from scratch with strangers in an online class, I get that; maybe post some observations or statements from the podcast that surprised you or immediately challenge your ideas about what this course might be about. Try to do this each week, and our Discord will start to feel like a 'real' place!

[Episode 1 Script/Transcript](transcripts/episode1)

I will sometimes also provide links to other interesting podcasts as I find them, and I encourage you to listen to them as well. For instance, this is a good one for us to start with: [New Thinking about Museums](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08v3fl5). This is optional.

> What are people saving and what's missing from museums? Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough talks to researchers Fiona Candlin, Henrietta Lidchi, Sarah Maltby, & Edward Harcourt.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08v3fl5

### Do

Tech Set Up Time!

#### 1. Get Hypothesis & Join Our Class Group

Create an account at [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is):

Get the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:

![](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/08/28181440/install.png)

Make sure you're logged in:

![](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/08/28181440/signin2.png)

Then join [our HIST4916a reading group](https://hypothes.is/groups/AQerk76W/4916a-museums-dh). If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the 'reply' button on the annotation to start a conversation! Sometimes, the person to whom you're replying might be a previous year's student, but that's ok; they might enter into conversation with you. Sometimes, it might be a person who isn't a Carleton student but is following along with the course. That's ok too. Be respectful!

[There is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Read that for the full information how using Hypothesis.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Hypothesis is the main tool we use to enable an asynchronous seminar discussion. Hypothesis exists on the open web, so make sure you're always making your annotations in the **group space**, not the **public** space. Finally, you may want to use the [crowdlaaers](https://crowdlaaers.org/) service to keep track of the global development of our annotation space - go to that site, click on 'Groups', and follow the prompts to connect your Hypothesis account to the service.

#### 2. Join our Discord

Discord is a chat server that also allows voice, video, and screensharing. We will use it in this class mostly as a social space and a space to get help, especially in the more technical aspects of what we're doing.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} I don't want heroic lone scholars. If you are struggling with something - whether it's the ideas in the readings or the tech - look for help; DM me privately, or post in the relevant week's channel. If you can help someone, jump in. **I encourage collaboration**. If you get help from someone, just acknowledge it in your own work. Also: **in tech work, if it doesn't come in 30 minutes, it won't come in 3 hours** Asking for help is not a weakness: it's a sign of strength & scholarly maturity.
{{< /notice >}}

You can download Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/apps) or you can [use it in a broswer](https://discordapp.com/app).

**You will receive an invitation email in your Carleton account.** It expires after one day, so do join once you get it. It will ask to verify your email; check your spam folder.

Once you're in, there's a welcome message with a reaction emoji at the end - click on the thumbs up to confirm that you've read the message. This will unlock the various channels in the server, including voice and screensharing.

And yes, I recycled screenshots from my Crafting Digital History course, but the DHMuse version is more or less the same and hey, I built this course website by hand.

![click-the-reaction](/images/discord/click-here.png)
(Alex is a student who works for me on [the bone trade project](http://bonetrade.github.io) if you were wondering.)

You can customize your profile by clicking on the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the navigation:

![options](/images/discord/options-location.png)

![user-info](/images/discord/user-info.png)

and you can customize how you'd like to use voice and video:

![voice](/images/discord/voice-settings.png)

There's a channel for each week's materials, a channel for general museum or Carleton chat, and a social channel just for shooting the breeze. If you want to chat or stream your machine (eg to show us what you're trying to do and how it's not working) just click on one of the side-chats - make sure you're unmuted! Dr. Graham also has a private office for voice and video and you can ask him directly to speak there.

What all the buttons do [help file](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/categories/200404398)

Discord has accessibility features, [more details here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035966492-Screen-Reader-Data-Toggle)

#### 3. Github

Github can be a bit tricky, so I've given it its own page, which you can [consult over here](/building/github-guidance). Just take your time. You should be able to do this in about 30 - 45 minutes.
