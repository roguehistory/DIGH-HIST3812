### Do


{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. Share the url to your repo in Discord. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

+ Create a repository on Github; you can make it private.

+ Make a text file and call it `journal.md`. Put the date in it, write brief notes so that when you come back to all of this, you'll know what you were doing. Bullet points are fine; whatever works for you. (You can also [do this in your browser while logged into Github](building/github-guidance/#making-a-new-text-file-on-github).)

+ Drag and drop this file, and any other supporting materials you wish, onto your repository; once they've uploaded, hit the 'commit' button. (Here's a [video showing this in action](building/github-guidance/#uploading-a-file-into-github).)

**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your eventual GLAM notebook you create. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.
