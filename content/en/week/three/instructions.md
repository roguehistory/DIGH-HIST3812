### Goals for this week

1. Read and think about your selected materials carefully
2. Listen to this week's Podcast
3. Improve your digital literacy

>"While debates have raged over whether digital humanities is a discipline, a field, a methodological toolkit, or some combination of these, the term broadly articulates a connection between computation, digital tools and media, and humanities based inquiry" (Risam 2019: 6).

>"Digital history is an approach to researching and interpreting the past that relies on computer and communication technologies to help gather, quantify, interpret, and share historical materials and narratives."

This class asks what is the "Past," what is "History," and what is Digital History or Digital Public History. David Dean notes, “Public history deals with the ways in which the past is created and presented in the public arena as history...[it] is about the ways in which the public engages with the past and about how the past is represented to the public” (Dean 2018: 2). So, if public history examines evidence from the "past" to create "history" for the present and future, then what is the public engaging with? Does the public engage with the past or a constructed historical narrative? Does this matter? What mediums are used to present the past as a narrative to the public? We will address the above questions through the following works: David Deans "Introduction," in A Companion to Public History, and Charles Hedrick Jr., "Monuments and Documents" and talk about how each author defines 'History' and the 'Past' and the implications of these definitions on presenting History to the public. We will finish by discussing how Brennan, Seefeldt and Thomas define "Digital History."

### Log your work

For your digital work, it is critical that you keep notes on what works, what doesn't, what error messages you received, what help you received from others, what websites you went to, and so on.

+ Use Hypothesis to annotate the readings.
+ Make notes in your Obsidian Vault. 
    
**While this isn't graded, per se**, you _will_ need this material when it comes to writing the documentation for your eventual GLAM notebook you create. Get in the habit of keeping careful _process_ notes.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. Share the url to your repo in Discord. I don't want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something.
