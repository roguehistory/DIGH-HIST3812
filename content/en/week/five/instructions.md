## Goals for this week

1. Get to know your fellow collaborators. Ask questions. Discover each other's digital interests.
2. Critically assess museums and websites for their representation of 'Byzantine' identity.
3. Create an action plan for your group project.
4. Answer the question: Should scholars continue or stop using the term Byzantine? Why?

## Where Are Byzantine Studies Performed?

>"Traditional academic work is often hidden behind subscription-only paywalls or written in the jargony language of the academy; [Douglas] Galbi's (and his fellow travellersâ€™) posts, by contrast, are freely and widely available on the internet and written in a plain and easily accessible style. It is almost certain, therefore, that their works have a larger audience than all but the most successful of their scholarly sources" (Goldwyn 2022: 428).

Adam Goldwyn is speaking about the public-facing side of Byzantine history and how alt-right groups are using and manipulating the Christian identity of Byzantium for their ideological goals. Goldwyn's chapter also speaks to the "othering" of Byzantine identity. That is, who is and is not included based on ideological motives. Do scholars create impenetrable barriers that the public can not break through, leading the public to search for alternatives, or does the ambiguity of "Byzantine" allow for identity manipulation? If the term "Byzantine" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term "Byzantine"? How does this affect public reception and consumption of 'Byzantine' identity? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity on the web and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites. We will excavate identities from museum websites and explore how museums create identity categories. Who is Byzantine? Who is Roman? Who is "Other"?
