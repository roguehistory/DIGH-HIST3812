# Situating Byzantium in Digital Spaces.


![DigiWeb](favicon/DigiWeb.png)

## Goals for this week

1. Get to know your fellow collaborators. Ask questions. Discover each other's digital interests.
2. Critically assess social media sites for their representation of 'Byzantine' identity.
3. Create an action plan for your group project.
4. Answer the question: Should scholars continue or stop using the term Byzantine? Why?

## Where Are Byzantine Studies Performed?

>"Traditional academic work is often hidden behind subscription-only paywalls or written in the jargony language of the academy; [Douglas] Galbi's (and his fellow travellers’) posts, by contrast, are freely and widely available on the internet and written in a plain and easily accessible style. It is almost certain, therefore, that their works have a larger audience than all but the most successful of their scholarly sources" (Goldwyn 2022: 428).

Adam Goldwyn is speaking about the public-facing side of Byzantine history and how alt-right groups are using and manipulating the Christian identity of Byzantium for their ideological goals. Goldwyn's chapter also speaks to the "othering" of Byzantine identity. That is, who is and is not included based on ideological motives. Do scholars create impenetrable barriers that the public can not break through, leading the public to search for alternatives, or does the ambiguity of "Byzantine" allow for identity manipulation? If the term "Byzantine" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term "Byzantine"? How does this affect public reception and consumption of 'Byzantine' identity? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity on the web and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites. We will excavate identities from museum websites and explore how museums create identity categories. Who is Byzantine? Who is Roman? Who is "Other"?

## Do

For our first case study, choose, critically assess and document a minimum of two social media platforms and consider how Byzantine history is being represented. How is social media being used to present and narrate 'Byzantine' identity to the global public? Additionally, choose two non-museum websites (NOT WIKIPEDIA) that present Byzantium and Byzantine identity to the public. Compare the language and imagery used on these websites to those from the social media platforms you chose, and discuss if the presented material/data on these sites are more publicly accessible and consumable than social media. Who are the target audiences? How do social media and websites use, if at all, any historical and archaeological evidence? Is the public performing Digital History if they use social media, blogs, etc. that are not peer-reviewed? What are the implications of performing/narrating Byzantine history over such platforms? 

{{< notice success "Reminder!" >}} Use the Hypothes.is and Obsidian to document and link your observations and digital excavating processes, and remember to cite the museums with [Hyperlinks](https://www.byzantinemuseum.gr/en/) to the relevant page when you use obsidian. What were some of the case study's challenges and successes? Link your thoughts to other individuals from other groups. {{< /notice>}}

On Tuesday (October 3rd), to begin, we will gather for our first case study in our assigned groups. We will spend the first 15 minutes or so getting to know each other, your interests, and what you would like to achieve in the course. Following this 'Meet and Greet,' begin exploring the web and social media for Byzantine "digital artifacts" and make a list, collaborate and decide a course of action on how your group should proceed in analyzing these sites. Decide on how you wish to address the week's questions. **Don't worry, you can change your research direction as you progress. It's never written in stone unless it's written in stone.** 

We will dive right into the meat and potatoes on Thursday, continue your research, and create a "Mind-Map" in Obsidian Canvas. That's right!! We are introducing a new Plugin. **IT'S FUN!!! Trust Me.** By the end of class, you should have a sense of how you want to answer your research question. A the end of class I want to discuss what your groups thoughts are on whether scholars should continue or stop using the term Byzantine. What effect does the scholarly use of the label "Byzantine" have on how the public perceives Eastern Roman identities?

In the following Tuesday's class, each group will present their results (this can be done seated at your group table) in a quick, maximum 5-minute presentation (of your choosing) that informs the class of the path you choose to pursue the week's research, what succeeded, what broke, or what crashed and burned, and what your answer is to the question. 

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Remember, I don't expect a conclusive, definitive answer! If you don't have an answer, just say, "We Don't Know, and here is why." **I am evaluating you on process** and how you think through the steps, analytically and digitally, to answer the question in question...make sense? If you bugger up, **Do Not Worry or Freak Out.** Document what happened and how you re-assessed and moved forward. Experiential learning is the goal. {{< /notice>}}
