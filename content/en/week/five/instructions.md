## Case Study #1: Situating Byzantium in Digital Spaces

![DigiWeb](favicon/DigiWeb.png)

### Goals for this week

1. Get to know your fellow collaborators. Ask questions. Discover each other's digital interests.
2. Critically assess museums and websites for their representation of 'Byzantine' identity.
3. Create an action plan for your group project.
4. Answer the question: Should scholars continue or stop using the term Byzantine? Why?

## Where Are Byzantine Studies Performed?

>"Traditional academic work is often hidden behind subscription-only paywalls or written in the jargony language of the academy; [Douglas] Galbi's (and his fellow travellers’) posts, by contrast, are freely and widely available on the internet and written in a plain and easily accessible style. It is almost certain, therefore, that their works have a larger audience than all but the most successful of their scholarly sources" (Goldwyn 2022: 428).

Adam Goldwyn is speaking about the public-facing side of Byzantine history and how alt-right groups are using and manipulating the Christian identity of Byzantium for their ideological goals. Goldwyn's chapter also speaks to the "othering" of Byzantine identity. That is, who is and is not included based on ideological motives. Do scholars create impenetrable barriers that the public can not break through, leading the public to search for alternatives, or does the ambiguity of "Byzantine" allow for identity manipulation? If the term "Byzantine" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term "Byzantine"? How does this affect public reception and consumption of 'Byzantine' identity? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity on the web and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites. We will excavate identities from museum websites and explore how museums create identity categories. Who is Byzantine? Who is Roman? Who is "Other"?

## Do

For our first case study, I want us to ask if 'we' (Historians, Archaeologists, Art Historians, Public Historians, Digital Humanists, and so on, and so on), should continue using the term 'Byzantine' to represent eastern medieval Roman society. Select and critically assess and document a minimum of two museum webpages (for example, the Byzantine and Christian Museum (BCM) in Athens or the Museum of Byzantine Culture (MBC) in Thessaloniki), and consider how we might re-imagine the public-facing presentation of Byzantine history on the web. How are the museums presenting and narrating 'Byzantine' identity to the public? 

Additionally, choose two non-museum websites (NOT WIKIPEDIA) that present Byzantium and Byzantine identity to the public. Compare the language and imagery used on these websites to those from the museums you explored this week, and discuss if the presented material/data on these sites are more publicly accessible and consumable than the information from the museums. Who are the websites' target audiences?  How do they use, if at all, any historical and archaeological evidence? 

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Use the Hypothes.is and Obsidian to document and link your observations and digital excavating processes, and remember to cite the museums with [Hyperlinks](https://www.byzantinemuseum.gr/en/) [SiteName](sitenameDotcom)to the relevant page. What were some of the case study's challenges and successes? Link your thoughts to other individuals from other groups. {{< /notice>}}

On Tuesday (October 3rd), to begin, we will gather for our first case study in our assigned groups. We will spend the first 30 minutes or so getting to know each other, your interests, and what you would like to achieve in the course. Following this 'Meet and Greet,' begin exploring the web and search for four museums that house 'Byzantine' artifacts and have 'Byzantine' galleries. Make a list, collaborate and decide a course of action on how your group should proceed in analyzing these museum websites. Decide on how you wish to address the week's questions. **Don't worry, you can change your research direction as you progress. It's never written in stone unless it's written in stone.** 

We will dive right into the meat and potatoes on Thursday, continue your research, and create a "Mind-Map" in Obsidian Canvas. That's right!! We are introducing a new Plugin. **IT'S FUN!!! Trust Me.** By the end of class, you should have a sense of how you want to answer the question: Should scholars continue or stop using the term Byzantine? Why? On the following Tuesday's class, each group we present their results (this can be done seated at your group table) in a 5-minute presentation (of your choosing) that informs the class of the path you choose to pursue your research, what succeeded, what broke, or what crashed and burned, and what your answer is to the question. 

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Remember, I don't expect a conclusive, definitive answer! If you don't have an answer, just say, "We Don't Know, and here is why." **I am evaluating you on process** and how you think through the steps, analytically and digitally, to answer the question in question...make sense? If you bugger up, **Do Not Worry or Freak Out.** Document what happened and how you re-assessed and moved forward. Experiential learning is the goal. {{< /notice>}}
