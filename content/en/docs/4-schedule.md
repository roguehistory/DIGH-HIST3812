Check out the [weekly instructions](/week) for detailed guidance for what you should be doing each week.

I estimate that the technical aspects of this course (the computational notebooks) will take about 17 hours over the duration of the course; see the weekly breakdown at the [Sequence of Technical Work](/building/tech-req-at-a-glance) page.

## TL;DR

_Remember to join our discord so we can actually have some social contact and remember that other breathing human beings are part of this course!_

The first third of this course is about getting started and choosing your own adventure through the materials I have already gathered for you. You will do a [deep annotation on the materials](building/dl-guidance).

The second third will be our asynchronous rotating discussion, conducted in the threads of the various annotations each of us will have prepped on our materials. In a given week, the focus will shift from one batch of materials to another as we [discuss collaboratively](building/cr-guidance/).

The final third will when we build our [GLAM workbench](building/nb-guidance/); the 'notebook' pages will be accompanied by documentation explaining how to use them, what a user might find, and tie this discussion into the literature we explored.
