# Overview:

You will be evaluated on Participation, three Podcast analyses **(due weeks 4, 7, 12)**, two case study investigations due at the end of their respective weeks **(weeks 5, 11)**, a Collaborative Project Proposal **(due Nov 2nd)**, and a Final digital collaborative project to be presented to the class during the final week of the term (Times to be determined in class).

## Real Names Policy

You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me why you wish to use a pseudonym. **It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message: ‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’…where xxxxx is the name you have selected.** No questions asked. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.

{{< alert theme="warning" >}} Do not attempt to speedrun this course. By 'speedrun' I mean, you leave it until the end and try to do all of the work in one intense session. Work done in that fashion cannot, by virtue of it all being dumped in my lap at the end of the course, take into account feedback, peer collaboration, or have any meaningful engagement with the materials. Thus, work done in this fashion cannot meet the learning goals of the course, with negative implications for your grade. Do not do this. {{< /alert >}}

## Grading:

### 1) Participation: 10%

Constructive and engaged participation in class is what I am looking for. Come to class prepared to discuss readings and podcasts with your peers. Participation also includes contributing to the class Obsidian Vault and Hypothesis Group. 

### 2) Podcast Analysis: 15% (5% each, 500-word max).

Students will be assigned three Podcast analyses to critically assess a podcast's presentation and representation of Byzantine history, archaeology or public history. The podcasts are meant to stimulate dialogue and expose students to the differences between reading academic work and listening to academics talk about their work. The objective is to get students to think critically about the in-between 'Digital' spaces of academic and public history and where these two fields intersect. In particular, we focus on the podcast *Byzantium and Friends*, but others will be assigned depending on the week's theme.

In Thursday’s classes, students will participate in a brief 30-minute class discussion to facilitate critical analysis for their written podcast analysis. In our 'Podcast Wrap-up,' we will discuss the podcast's themes, target audiences and whether podcasts are a valuable medium to present academic work to the public. _**Podcasts are considered part of the reading requirements for the course, and students are expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned podcasts in class.**_ You can refer to discussions from Thursday’s class in your analysis. You must provide a thesis statement and evidence to support your claims for each podcast analysis. 

### 3) Collaborative Project Proposal: 10% (500-word max).

Proposals will be assessed on collaborative contributions that focus on the process of developing a detailed plan for group execution of your project; with a singular group proposal being submitted in class on November 2nd. The writing of the proposal, along with any additional documents, media, etc., should be a shared effort. You may, for example, want to use Google Docs to create a shared document that you and your group can collaborate and contribute to. As with many co-authored history articles and archaeological projects, cooperation and compromise are key for a successful project. History is not written or digitized by one person. Not one person digs an entire archaeological site and then writes the report. It’s a team effort, and not all teams have equal strengths. But together, we can build a more inclusive digital history.

Thus, **be supportive** of your peers if you see an individual struggling. **Help**, **encourage, and be compassionate.** We all have lives outside of the classroom, and we all are dealing with personal stuff.  Reach out if you need help. The ‘Digital’ is ever-evolving and changes daily in a blink of an eye. No one can keep on top of the newest digital craze. I know I can’t. **What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go.** For your proposals, we will discuss how to proceed in a collaborative manner in more detail during class.

{{< alert theme="warning" >}} **Your final project proposal should include the following:**

1) The basic topic/idea that you are interested in pursuing (i.e. what will this project be about); this might include a historical period or place, events or persons, or ideas etc.).

2) The medium you will use to build your project (is it a game? A podcast? A virtual story? A blog?).

3) Any specific software or tools you know you will use and how you intend to acquire them.

4) A basic roadmap that outlines how you are going to pursue your research and build this project.

5) An early bibliography that includes 4-6 potential sources you are thinking of using in your research.{{< /alert >}}

### 4) Case Studies: 30% (15% each)

In archaeological fieldwork, teams of individuals excavate designated trenches that may contain material culture from varying periods. Therefore, archaeological trenches can quickly become highly complex, with large amounts of data being recorded daily from different individuals. When this data is combined with data from other trenches, analysis and interpretation can become significantly complex. Therefore, methodical, clear and concise note-taking is critical to keep data organized and coherent so it can be synthesized, analyzed, and interpreted individually and jointly with data from individual or multiple trenches. Thus, field notebooks are critical tools for archaeologists and Historians to interpret and produce knowledge about the past. Case Studies will mimic how archaeologists record evidence/data and synthesize it into a homogenous corpus that reflects all the work undertaken during a field season. As the "Director" of this mock digital archaeology site, I will oversee how your group records its "data" (whatever that entails). Follow the Templates I provide (I will explain more about these in class during week Two), and at the end of the term, your group will synthesize the evidence for your final projects. 

Each case study is worth 15% of your total mark for a total of 30%. You will be assessed on your collaborative (Week total 7.5%) work and documentation (Week total 7.5%). Therefore, you **MUST attend both classes for that week's case study to be in a position to receive full marks.** If you miss a class, you will lose 7.5% of that week’s grade. Each Case Study draws from the previous week's themes and gives students the opportunity to achieve experiential and collaborative learning objectives. Case studies focus on the process and NOT the final product. Thus, how you contribute to each case study is weighed heavier than your final product. Case studies are designed to inform your final Public-Facing project to be presented at the end of term. These exercises allow you to experiment and play with different digital approaches and document what did or did not work for your group. What your group learned from these experiential activities, and how they will inform your final project? Details of case studies will be presented in the first week of class.

### 5) Final Project: 35%

The final project will be evaluated on both individual and group criteria. 10% based on your individual contribution to the final project, 10% on the project's historical and digital content (This will be based on your deliverable submitted to me to assess) and 15% based on your group's final project presentation (Each group member **MUST** present a component of their final project). The final project will be submitted to the professor at 11:59 pm the night before your group presentation.

## Late Penalties and When Life Intervenes

Work that is submitted late will receive a 2% penalty per day up to 7 days, in which case the student will receive a zero. However, there’s nothing we can’t roll within this class, but I can’t help you if I don’t know you need help; breathing space, some direction, or extra time due to personal reasons. When something comes up, just let me know. You don’t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. **I trust you**. When something comes up and this course has to move to the back burner, contact me, and we can **figure out something else to do or something else that will help you be successful here.


{{< notice success "Important" >}}
I was an undergrad and I know how busy a term can get, especially during mid-terms. **Thus, If you feel like there's just too much happening** we can adjust expectations. Do not hesitate to say that there's too much - quote this notification at me! Email me! I am **happy to rearrange things** if we need to. I'm not out to get anyone. **It’s our course - we can change things up as we need to**
