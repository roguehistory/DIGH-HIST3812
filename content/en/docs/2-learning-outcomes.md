### Questions to think about

What impact(s) does the ‘Digital’ have on the production of ancient and medieval history for public consumption? 

What is Digital History? What does performing a Digital Public History or a Public Digital History mean?

How do institutions digitally represent Byzantium to the public?

Do digital techs push us towards particular voices/opinions of Byzantium?

Can/do digital techs in the service of GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) perform colonial practices that erase ancient and medieval identities from communities? And if so, how? And what can we do about it?

_This course is an opportunity to explore these questions; I do not know the answers! I'm excited to figure these out with you. Why not annotate this section with some of your own questions?_

**Nb** The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you -- The "WE" factor -- as mentioned in the [Epilogue](https://digitalbyzantine.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/#:~:text=for%20public%20consumption%3F-,Epilogue%3A,-You%20will%20notice). Sometimes things will not work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don't go according to plan is, in fact, _according to plan_.

### Learning Outcomes:

1) Discuss, contextualize and conduct independent and collaborative research on Byzantine Studies as a discipline within Digital History frameworks.

2) Identify cultural heritage and ethical issues concerning material culture and Digital Cultural Heritage.

3) Implement and contribute to various digital mediums that demonstrate critical thought on how digital history is implemented in historical and archaeological research. 

4) Discuss the impact open data sources have on historical narrative creation in digital history and digital humanities.
  
5) Create a public-facing project utilizing the digital methods that reflect what you have learned in the course. 

By the end of the course, students should be able to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources within the prism of Digital Humanities. Students will be able to 1) evaluate and critically assess digital representations of that past, 2) apply historical, archaeological and digital methodologies, and 3) conduct independent and collaborative research that demonstrates a student's abilities to critically evaluate historical thinking in order to 4) produce a public-facing digital project within a group/collaborative environment.
