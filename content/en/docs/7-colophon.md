This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and [separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown). I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github. Then, I have [netlify.com](http://netlify.com) watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up to the world.

I am thankful and grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Shawn Graham, who allowed me to repo, borrow, pillage, steal, use and repurpose his HIST4916 website (available via [shawngraham/hist4916](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist4916).
