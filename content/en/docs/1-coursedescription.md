## Overview

What impact(s) does the ‘Digital’ have on the production of ancient and medieval history for public consumption? What is Digital History? What does it mean to perform a Digital Public History or a Public Digital History? In this course, we will explore the above questions by introducing students to the Digital Public History and Archaeology of Byzantium (330 - 1453 CE) and the approaches used to create digital narratives around Byzantine History and Archaeology for public consumption. We will discuss who the Byzantines were (Romans or _Romaioi_), where they lived (the Eastern Roman Empire/Romanland or _Rhōmania_), and how the ‘digital’ influences the construction of narratives around Byzantine artifacts to represent Byzantine history for digital consumption by the public.

In this course, we will experiment with different digital tools and discuss their impact on how you create historical narratives. We reflect on how current digital methods in our historical and archaeological are currently used in the analysis of Byzantium and their effect on its public image. Through experiential learning exercises and case studies, students will actively explore and critically investigate the intersection of Byzantine history, archaeology, and digital humanities within public history. The course emphasizes the ‘digital process’ with the goal of providing students with the digital skills, tools, and knowledge to confidently navigate, investigate and critically evaluate historical or archaeological narratives and pursue their interests for their final digital projects. **However, this does not mean the course will be tech-heavy.**

Instead, students will be exposed to digital tools and encouraged to think about questions such as, what constitutes legitimate medieval history in a digital society? How are authorship, content creation, and user engagement with digital history defined? Who pays for free software? Can Digital Heritage and Digital Artifacts be owned? What does the profusion of popular medieval historical representations in digital media mean for the future of academic history? Is the podcast a legitimate medium to disseminate academic research compared to the monograph or academic journal? And, finally, what represents best practices for teaching medieval history in a digital world for public consumption?

## Epilogue:

You will notice that I often use common vernacular and "WE" often. Why? First, [H]istory is narrative construction and storytelling that needs to be engaging and socially relatable. Otherwise, why bother? This is especially true for Digital History, as we will learn in this course. However, public engagement doesn't mean dumbing down scholarly research, either. We need to foster a middle ground where academic and public history can be informative, challenging, and engaging for all. Therefore, I don't want to inundate you with technical jargon and scare you away (that would be counter-productive). Instead, I want to challenge you to think about how **WE,** as historians, archaeologists, public historians, digital humanists, and the public, can reframe, narrate and make Byzantine history digitally enchanting.

We will focus on processes and discuss complex topics without the expectation that you will know all the technical jargon. Secondly, the "We" is precisely what it means. You and I will explore together, discuss, and collaborate throughout the course. Western academia/universities are embedded with colonialist structures that have created hierarchal systems that produce power structures. The professor-student relationship is one of those structures that, in some cases, can oppress or discourage the student's ability to be creative and produce new and insightful historical narratives. I want to promote and enable a constructive learning environment that focuses on rigorous, creative historical narrative construction. [My Gothic Dissertation](https://www.mygothicdissertation.com)  by Dr. Anna Williams, provides excellent examples of exploited power imbalances in academia between professor and student over and above the thesis' exploration of the Gothic literary genre.) **Moreover, I am learning from you in this class just as much as you are learning from me.**

**You do not need to be 'techy' to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open.**
{{< /alert >}}

This course is not as tech heavy as some of my other classes. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. **The key is to be open** and willing to talk about when things don't go as expected.

You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead.  What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. **Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.**

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
My goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner.

It's going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That's why the assessment for this course is built around the _process_, not the final _product_.

### Text/Tech
To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.


### Class format
This class will be delivered in-person with the expectation that students attend class ready to collaborate with their peers. **Collaboration is essential to produce effective and engaging public-facing History and Archaeology.** A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. Students will maintain various materials on the class Obsidian Vault via Dropbox, which I will add you to with your carleton email account. 

### Your Success

Your success in this class is dependent on three principles:

1) **Come Prepared**. Do the readings, come prepared to each class to discuss, and collaborate with me and your peers. Each class is designed to explore and discuss the assigned readings and podcasts and how they can inform our research objectives and goals. I will not be lecturing for an hour and a half each class. But I might nerd out and gab your ear off.

2) **Be Fearless**. Despite what Yoda might think: "Do – or do not. There is no try." (Starwars, Episode V), I want you to **TRY** new tools and venture into the swampy digital unknown. Be fearless and swing for the fences. Don’t worry if something does not go to plan. The digital is a process – a journey – which we will navigate together despite what Yoda says.

3) **Fail Gloriously**. Words I live by now (Thank you, Dr. Shawn Graham). So…when we try new methods, theories and digital tools, we are bound to mess up. Digital things will break or not work: that is expected. If you can say, 'I wonder _why_ this broke? Can you help me?' and you will be successful here.


For this course to work well, I require you to be on the same page as me. **COMMUNICATION IS NECESSARY** Do not be afraid to ask a question. Please come see me during office hours or by appointment if you need help or feel discouraged. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone too. The key thing is always to tie what you're doing with what you're reading and what you're thinking. That 'second layer of difficulty' will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that's where the learning happens.

...and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.
