Check out the [weekly instructions](/week) for detailed guidance for what you should be doing each week.

## Course Structure: 

The course was developed to simulate how archaeological and curatorial practices are accomplished in a variety of collaborative environments. Each week, students are expected to come prepared to class and participate in discussions about the assigned readings and podcasts. Week one provides a general introduction to the course, with an overview of the course's overarching themes, objectives, goals and assessments. We will discuss and begin to apply *[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)*, a note-taking manager (details provided in week one's overview), to our course objectives.

**Phase one (weeks 2 - 4)** will expose students to the concepts and themes in academic history, public history, and digital humanities. Through these frameworks, we will discuss the creation of Byzantine studies in the nineteenth century and the effect this has on digital representations in digital public spaces. We end each phase with an experiential learning Case Study where we apply what we have learned from the previous weeks to a tangible project. These Case Studies focus on the process of digital history-making and **NOT** a definitive end product. By the end of phase one, students should come away with a general knowledge of the development of Byzantine studies, problems associated with the terms Byzantine and Byzantine Empire, as well as how they affect identity representation and the digital platforms used to create these historical narratives. 

**Week 5: Case Study #1** 

**Phase two (weeks 6-10)** begins our journey into Byzantine archaeology. We will ask what digital Byzantine archaeology is and if there is a public-facing digital archaeology of the medieval world. We explore the journey from excavation, documentation, and curation and how objects are exhibited via analog and digital means for public consumption. This will include themes in Data collection, Data interpretation and Database creation, as well as Digital Post-Colonial thought and the Digital Subaltern. We will explore pseudo-archaeology and the impact of digital media on the representation of archaeology in film, video games, and social media. We will discuss how media platforms use archaeological data to create historical narratives for public consumption. By the end of phase two, students will debate whether museums should continue using the label Byzantine to represent the medieval Eastern Roman Empire.

**Week 11: Case Study #2**

**The last phase (weeks 12-14)** centres around digital methods and theory to (re)address how Byzantine (or what label we agree upon) identity can be reinterpreted, re-imagined, and presented to the public in a more informative, inclusive and enchanting format. In phase three, we dive into the meat and potatoes for creating digital enchantment around Byzantine history. We explore concepts in cultural heritage and cultural property, "agile" objects and the "Digital Twin," how the sensorial creates effective public engagement with emotive intersections to help facilitate the creation of enchantment, and narrative visualization. Furthermore, I will introduce you to Roman and Byzantine coins in their physical state and with 3D models in order to experience the emotive differences when engaging with coins in these mediums. This leads us to the final project of the course (described in the assessments section), which will be digitally based and collaboratively produced. See the [4. Assessment â€“ HIST3812a](https://digitalbyzantine.netlify.app/docs/4-assessment/) section for due dates and grading breakdown.

### When Life Intervenes

There's nothing we can't roll with, in this class. That said, I can't help you if I don't know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} You don't have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.
{{< /notice >}}

When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can **figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here**. It's our course - we can change things up as we need to.
