Check out the [weekly instructions](/week) for detailed guidance for what you should be doing each week.

## Course Structure: 

The course was developed to simulate how archaeological and curatorial practices are accomplished in a variety of collaborative environments. Each week, students are expected to come prepared to class and participate in discussions about the assigned readings and podcasts. Week one provides a general introduction to the course, with an overview of the course's overarching themes, objectives, goals and assessments. We will discuss and begin to apply *[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)*, a note-taking manager (details provided in week one's overview), to our course objectives.

Phase one (weeks 2 - 4) will expose students to the concepts and themes in academic history, public history, and digital humanities. Through these frameworks, we will discuss the creation of Byzantine studies in the nineteenth century and the effect this had on the development of national and historical narratives for Roman and Byzantine history and identity in digital public spaces. We end each phase with an experiential learning Case Study where we apply what we have learned from the previous weeks to a tangible project. These Case Studies focus on the process of digital history-making and **NOT** a definitive end product. By the end of phase one, students should come away with a general knowledge of the development of Byzantine studies, problems associated with the terms Byzantine and Byzantine Empire, as well as how they affect identity representation and the digital platforms used to create these historical narratives. 

Week 5: Case Study #1 

Phase two (weeks 6-10) begins our journey into Byzantine archaeology. We will ask what digital Byzantine archaeology is and if is there a public-facing digital archaeology of the medieval world. We explore the journey from excavation, documentation, curation and finally how objects are digitally exhibited for public consumption. This will include themes in cultural heritage and cultural property, digital pseudo-archaeology, the impact of digital media on the representation of archaeology in film, video games, social media, and more.  By the end of phase two, students will debate whether museums should continue using the label Byzantine to represent the medieval Eastern Roman Empire.

The last phase (weeks 11-14) centres around digital methods and theory to (re)address how Byzantine (or what label we agree upon) identity can be reinterpreted, re-imagined, and presented to the public in a more informative, inclusive and enchanting format. In phase three, we dive into the meat and potatoes for creating digital enchantment around Byzantine history. We explore concepts of "agile" objects and how the sensorial creates effective public engagement with emotive intersections to help facilitate the creation of enchantment. We discuss interpretation processes in post-data collection and narrative visualization. Furthermore, I will introduce you to Roman and Byzantine coins in their physical state and with 3D models in order to experience the emotive differences when engaging with coins in these mediums. This leads us to the final project of the course (described in the assessments section), which will be digitally based and collaboratively produced. See the assessments section for due dates and grading breakdown.

## TL;DR

_Remember to join our discord so we can actually have some social contact and remember that other breathing human beings are part of this course!_

The first third of this course is about getting started and choosing your own adventure through the materials I have already gathered for you. You will do a [deep annotation on the materials](building/dl-guidance).

The second third will be our asynchronous rotating discussion, conducted in the threads of the various annotations each of us will have prepped on our materials. In a given week, the focus will shift from one batch of materials to another as we [discuss collaboratively](building/cr-guidance/).

The final third will when we build our [GLAM workbench](building/nb-guidance/); the 'notebook' pages will be accompanied by documentation explaining how to use them, what a user might find, and tie this discussion into the literature we explored.
